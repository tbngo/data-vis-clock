# data-vis-clock

Hey! ðŸ‘‹

You've managed to come across my A0 assignment for Intro to Data Visualizations (COMS 4995) where we needed to build a static webpage of a creative interpretation of the clock, focused on aesthetics and inventiveness.

My project is live at https://thengo1.github.io/data-vis-clock/!
